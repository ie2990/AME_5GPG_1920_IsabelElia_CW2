## Package 1: 2D Controller

### 03/03/20
I started creating a 2D Character Controller, and looked back over the programming classes I did back in Year 1. Unfortunately this was quite a while ago, so I only had a few lines of code that I could find. 
So decided to look over some tutorials, which you could find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkz29pKkZu0&list=PLl3CdNrMyGa8OllUg3RHFTITBjyd4oG9i&index=20&t=0s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQvicrPb3ok&list=PLpj8TZGNIBNy51EtRuyix-NYGmcfkNAuH&index=6).

Writing up the Documentation was harder then I expected. I was struggling not to have it read too much like a tutorial but still be easy enough to follow that the components could be utilised with ease.

## Package 2: Collectables

### 17/03/20

I started with looking up how to create a collectable, like coins in Mario etc. I started by following these Unity tutorials [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpgG7nBQxFc), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYoEMqK_Fo), and [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38i4JQguH9s).
I really struggled to get it working, so I checked out and followed some more tutorials, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tUIReIlbjI&list=PLl3CdNrMyGa8OllUg3RHFTITBjyd4oG9i&index=19&t=156s) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PXumKWrxpw&list=PLpj8TZGNIBNy51EtRuyix-NYGmcfkNAuH&index=20).
I tweaked the code and _finally_ got it working.

### 31/03/20
Began writing up the documentation for this package. Seemed to be more cohesive than the first attempt. Maybe I'll update the documentation for the `2D Controller` so they all match.

## Package 3: Respawn

### 02/04/20
So I found this surprisingly easy in comparision to the last two. I think this is because the process for `Respawn` was very similar to that of the `Collectables`.
I managed to do this by myself, utilising the knowledge I had from the previous package.
It took some tweaking and troubleshooting but I managed it without the help of an online tutorial! (which is a really big deal for me!)

### 14/04/20
Completed the documentation.

## Package 4: Scene Selector

### 21/04/20
So I had the code for this as I done a Menu/Scene Selector as part of my submission last semester. So all I really had to do was adapt the tutorial into some accompanying documentation.

## Small Game Project

### 01/05/2020
It was alot easier to put the packages together than I expected. What took the longest was organising the files and documentation, and remembering how to upload it all to GitHub.
